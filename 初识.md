### Reliable

When launched from the user's home screen, service workers enable a Progressive Web App to load instantly, regardless of the network state.

A `service worker`, written in JavaScript, is like a client-side proxy and puts you in control of the cache and how to respond to resource requests. By pre-caching key resources you can eliminate the dependence on the network. 



### Engaging 

PWA offer an `immersive full screen` experience with help from a web app `manifest` file and can even re-engage users with web `push notifications`.

so, two inportant topics:
